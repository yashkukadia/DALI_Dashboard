# DALI_Dashboard
https://yashkukadia.github.io/DALI_Dashboard/

This is a dashboard that is a "Meet the Team" page for members of DALI Lab at Dartmouth College. It gets this information from an API and displays it accordingly.

Some features to note:
- Clicking on the profile Name redirects the user to the personal website of that team member
- Clicking on DALI lab nav bar on the top redirects to http://dali.dartmouth.edu/
- The "projects" attribute is only displayed when it has more than zero entries and provided that the entry is not ""

Assumptions:
- The attributes in the JSON API are non-NULL

Upcoming features:
- Although the web app is responsive to most laptops, it will soon be configured for tablets and mobile phones
- Geomapping using Google Maps API
